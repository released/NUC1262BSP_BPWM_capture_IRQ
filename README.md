update @ 2022/06/23

1. use BPWM1 CH0 (PF.15) , to generate PWM freq and duty

2. use BPWM2 CH4 (PB.1) , to capture input signal freq and duty

3. use terminal , to adjust PWM freq (digit 1 : increase , digit 2 : derease)

4. use terminal , to adjust PWM duty (letter a/A : increase , letter d/D : derease)

5. display the capture high/low period/freq/duty by terminal

6. below is log capture ,
